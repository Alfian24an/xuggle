Welcome to Xuggler

The following is a general outline for installing Xuggler.  Please see:

  http://www.xuggle.com/xuggler/downloads/build.jsp

for details about these steps.

0) Make sure you have the following software:

  - Java JDK 1.5 or 1.6 (preferred)
  - Ant 1.7
  - Perl 5.6 or higher (needed for C++ test suite)
  - G++ 3.4 or higher
  - Gmake 3.81 or higher
  - If Windows:
    - A version of MSVC++ that contains the "lib" tool (MSFT now
      provides a free compiler).
    - The very latest MSYS and Mingw releases (w32 runtime
      3.15.1 or higher), and preferrably gcc 4.3 or higher.

1) Set a home for Xuggler

  Define an environment variable called XUGGLE_HOME which points to
  where you want the Xuggler software installed.

  For example, on Unix:

    export XUGGLE_HOME=/usr/local

  For example, on Mac:
  
    export XUGGLE_HOME=/usr/local/xuggler
    sudo mkdir /usr/local/xuggler

  For example on Windows, in the Windows Environment variable space, set
  XUGGLE_HOME t point to:
   
    C:\msys\local

2) Tell your OS about where to find Xuggler

  Add $XUGGLE_HOME/bin to your PATH variable, and $XUGGLE_HOME/lib to
  your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac) variable

  For example on Linux:

    export PATH=$XUGGLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$XUGGLE_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  For example on Mac:

    export PATH=$XUGGLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$XUGGLE_HOME/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
    for i in {1..40}; do export xuggler$i=foo; done

  NOTE: See http://www.xuggle.com/xuggler/downloads/build.jsp if you are
  confused.

  For example on Windows (there is no need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH):

    PATH=%XUGGLE_HOME%\bin:%PATH%

3) Build and Test Xuggler

  From the area where you checked out or unpacked this distribution,
  run:

  For example:

    ant run-tests

  This will configure the native code, compile it, compile all java code
  and run the internal test suite.  If it finishes successfully you can
  install Xuggle.

4) Install Xuggle

  From the area where you checked out or unpacked the distruction, run:

  For example on Windows and Linux:

    ant install

  For example on Mac:

    su root
    ant install
    exit

  If you've not set $XUGGLE_HOME, or set it to a privileged area, you
  may need to elevate privledges on your OS.
