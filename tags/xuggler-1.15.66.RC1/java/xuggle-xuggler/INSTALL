Welcome to Xuggle

In general to install Xuggle do the following steps:

0) Make sure you have the following software:
  - Java JDK 1.5 or 1.6 (preferred)
  - Ant 1.7
  - Perl 5.6 or higher (needed for C++ test suite)
  - G++ 3.4 or higher
  - Gmake 3.81 or higher
  - If Windows:
    - The very latest MSYS and Mingw releases (w32 runtime
      3.15.1 or higher), and preferrably gcc 4.3 or higher.

1) Set a home for Xuggle

   Define an environment variable called XUGGLE_HOME which points to
   where you want Xuggle software installed.

   For example, on Unix or Mac:
   export XUGGLE_HOME=/usr/local

   For example on Windows:
   In the Windows Environment variable space, set XUGGLE_HOME to point
   to C:\msys\local

2) Tell your OS about where to find Xuggle

   Add $XUGGLE_HOME/bin to your PATH variable, and $XUGGLE_HOME/lib to your
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac) variable

   For example on Linux:
   export PATH=$XUGGLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$XUGGLE_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   For example on Mac:
   export PATH=$XUGGLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
   export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$XUGGLE_HOME/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

   For example on Windows (there is no need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH):
   PATH=%XUGGLE_HOME%\bin:%PATH%

3) Build and Test Xuggle
  From the area where you checked out or unpacked this distribution, run:
   ant run-tests
  This will configure the native code, compile it, compile all java
  code and run the internal test suite.  If it finishes successfully
  you can install Xuggle.

4) Install Xuggle
  From the area where you checked out or unpacked the distruction, run:
    ant install
  If you've not set $XUGGLE_HOME, or set it to a priledged area, you 
  may need to elevate privledges on your OS:
    sudo ant install
