This directory contains software packages that this
library needs installed in order to build, and that will
be included in the installation of this library.

The configure script for the main library should enable or
disable captives, and if enabled, then these libraries get
configured and build when building the main library.

The libraries will be installed using the GNU AUTOCONF
standard DISTDIR hack into a directory that is local to
the build tree of the main library.  When the main library
is installed, then the captive installation directory will be
copied over as well into the same root.  Captive libraries
will be configured with the same $(prefix) that the main
library was configured with.

Lastly, believe it or not, this entire captive system
(complicated as it seems) is here so that the vast majority
of users don't need to worry about building ffmpeg -- we
build it for them.
