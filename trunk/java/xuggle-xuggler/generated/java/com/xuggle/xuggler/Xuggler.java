/**
 * A very simple command line program that decodes a video file, and re-encodes it to a new file.
 * <p>
 * Very loosely based on the FFMPEG command line program, just with far fewer
 * bells and whistles.  It is meant many as a demonstration program for those trying
 * to learn this library.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To use, make sure that the Xuggler shared libraries have been installed in your system, and
 * then run (from the root of your build tree):
 * <code>
 * <pre>
 * java -jar dist/lib/xuggle-xuggler.jar --help
 * </pre>
 * </code>
 * And yes, I hate Java classpaths as much, if not more, than you do.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In reality, the {@link Converter} program does all the work here.
 * @see com.xuggle.xuggler.Converter
