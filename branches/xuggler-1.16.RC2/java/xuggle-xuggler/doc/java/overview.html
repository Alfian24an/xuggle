    "To Xuggle": To encode, decode, and generally juggle audio and
      video files in any way that you want.
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
This release contains a collection of Java libraries that
Xuggle is letting loose on the world.  
<p>
Our intention in open sourcing these libraries is to break down the walls
of communication between people.  To that end, a lot of these libraries deal
with getting at raw data for different systems, and for helping people to share
and create cool stuff using that data.
</p>
<p>
That said, it is not our intent to encourage people to use these libraries for
illegal purposes, and we explicitly encourage people to respect the rights of others
when they use these libraries.
</p>
<h1>Libraries</h1>
Here is a brief summary of the current libraries in this release:
<h2>The Xuggler</h2>
A Java Library for encoding and decoding pretty much any Internet available audio or video file.  See {@link com.xuggle.xuggler}
<p>
This Java library is a wrapper around the excellent <a href="http://ffmpeg.org">
  FFMPEG</a> libav* libraries.  It allows Java developers (after installing
the Xuggler native libraries) to encode and decode
video files, but in a very Java-like way (i.e. automatic garbage
collection, and fewer ways to cause bad crashes).
</p>
<p>
Read more about {@link com.xuggle.xuggler the details here}
or jump straight to the
<a href="{@docRoot}/src-html/com/xuggle/xuggler/Converter.html">
com.xuggle.xuggler.Converter</a>
program source code for
an example of Xuggler converting a media file.
</p>
<h2>Xuggler IO</h2>
A Java Library for allowing people to plug in custom data sources for
Xuggler to use.  See {@link com.xuggle.xuggler.io}
<p>
Xuggler uses FFMPEG's libav libraries to do the encoding and 
decoding of fils.  By default FFMPEG can read files, and some
other protocols (like http), but it implements all IO itself.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately FFMPEG comes with a way to extend the data sources
it can read; unfortunately it's a call back mechanism.  Still,
the Xuggler IO library allows you to implement IO callbacks for
FFMPEG in the language of your choice (Java) as opposed to native
C code.
</p>
<p>
See the {@link com.xuggle.xuggler.io.FileProtocolHandler FileProtocolHandler}
for a Java example of this (really just re-implements FFMPEG's file://
IO for illustration purposes).
</p>
<p>
Or better yet, check out the <a href="http://www.xuggle.com/opensource/xuggle-xuggler-red5">Xuggler Red5 Adapter</a> for an example of a
Xuggler IO plugin that allows the <a href="http://red5.googlecode.com/">Red5</a>
Open Source Media Server to decode and re-encode video files on the
the fly (really).
</p>
<h2>Ferry</h2>
A set of Java classes for <i>ferrying</i> data to and from native code.
See {@link com.xuggle.ferry}
<p>
<a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a>, an excellent utility for wrapping native code for other languages
does a lot of great things.  But sometimes it can use some help, and that's where this library comes in.
This library implements the reference-counting memory scheme (used by the {@link com.xuggle.xuggler Xuggler} package)
to allow native code to pass objects in to other languages and
relatively seamlessly integrate with their garbage collection
systems.  It also provides mechanism for allocating memory from
the other language (instead of the C++ heap)
to help that language keep track of memory, mechanisms for
logging in the other language, and mechanisms
for allowing the other language to directly modify C++/C memory
(if possible).  Most people won't use this
outside of the Xuggler library, but if you're curious, go digging. 
It relies HEAVILY on SWIG for a lot of the heavy lifting.
<h1>Licensing</h1>
All Xuggle Open Source Libraries are released either under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html">Lesser GPL 2.1 or later</a>
or under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPL 2.0 or later</a>.
See the COPYING file in each library for details.
<p>
We generally prefer the LGPL, but sometimes we
are required to release under GPL (for example, use of FFMPEG's libswscale library requires
the use of the GPL, so if you want to access the com::xuggle::xuggler::IVideoResampler object in the Xuggler library,
you need to compile a GPL version).  In these cases, we still try to provide a reduced functionality
LGPL license if possible.
